## Basic 

* Linear Algebra

* CS229  
(Stat foundation...)

* CS231n   
(Style Transfer / Self-supervised / Attention / Video...) 


## Architecture

* Spatial Pyramid Matching


## Self-Supervised Learning

* Grayscale to Color (Self-supervised)

* Sketch to Grayscale


## NeRF

* Nerf

* Image to animation...inbetweening (NeRF)

* Nerf + Style Transfer


## Possible direction with attacks

* Image to animation...generative + style

* Video segmentation (Layered Neural Atlases + Inpainting)


## Further direction

* Image to 3D function

* Function mapping animation
