# Basic

I just wanna try out `mathjax` here. This looks so cool.

Let the distribution $$\phi(\hat x)$$ aim to model the real distribution $$\phi(x)$$. It is obtained through marginalizing $$\phi(\hat x, Z) = \phi(Z) \phi(\hat x\mid Z)$$. 

Since $$Z = z_k$$ is the latent variable here, assuming a Gaussian mixture distribution, we can obtain:

$$
\phi(\hat x) = \sum_{k=1}^N \phi(Z = z_k) \phi(\hat x|z_k) = \sum_{k=1}^N \phi(Z = z_k) \mathcal{N}(\hat x|\mu_k, \sigma_k)
$$

The second equation describes the conditional probability of a CRF (Conditional Random Field) where $$x_i$$ implies the hand-written digit, $$y_i$$ implies the predicted digit $$\in$$ 26 alphabets. $$y_{i-1}$$ denotes the predcted digit comes before $$y_i$$.

We asumme the predicted digit $$y_i$$ correlates **only** with $$x_i$$ and $$y_{i-1}$$:

$$
P(y|x) = \frac{1}{Z(x)} \phi(x_1, y_1) \prod_{i=2}^n \phi(y_{i-1}, y_i) \phi(x_i, y_i)
$$

where $$Z(x)$$ is the partition function:

$$
Z(x) = \sum_y \phi(x_1, y_1) \prod_{i=2}^n \phi(y_{i-1}, y_i) \phi(x_i, y_i)
$$

As we maximize $$y$$, the partition function can be ignored (since it depends on $$x$$ only):

$$
\arg\max_y \phi(x_1, y_1) \prod_{i=2}^n \phi(y_{i-1}, y_i) \phi(x_i, y_i)
$$
