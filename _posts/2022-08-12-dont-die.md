# Don't Die

I played League of Legends. 

I was eager to climb rank, so I studied how the pros play the game.

<br>
My moves do either **one of the two** things:

1. <span style="color:#0366D6;">**Increase P(win)**</span>  
(i.e. Earning gold / Pushing towers)

2. <span style="color:#FF8970">**Decrease P(win)**</span>  
(i.e. Dying / Losing towers)  

<br>
In order to win, the strategy is simple:

1. <span style="color:#0366D6;">**Increase P(win)**</span>  
(i.e. Earning gold / Pushing towers)

2. <span style="color:#FF8970;">**Decrease P(win)**</span> **<-- *Minimize***   
(i.e. Dying / Losing towers)  

<br>
By default, my moves are either <span style="color:#0366D6;">**(1)**</span> or <span style="color:#FF8970;">**(2)**</span>. By minimizing <span style="color:#FF8970;">**(2)**</span>, I am also maximizing <span style="color:#0366D6;">**(1)**</span>.

Since it is a zero-sum game, it also means I am ***minimizing* the opponent's chance of winning**.

### Applications

This seems to be highly applicable to domains that have a low chance of success.

Any creative projects / business fall into this category.
